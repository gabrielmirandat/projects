'active contours (snakes)' 
probabilisticos: Bayesian model ('kalman filter', 'centroidianos com correlação', 'extended kalman filter', 'particle filter (Monte Carlo)')

cap 2 = snakes and extended snakes (gradient descent)
cap 3 = probabilisticos (basic Bayesian model : kalman filter, centroidianos e correlação, alpha-beta filter, extended kalman filter)
cap 4 = Monte Carlo methods (particle filter)
cap 5 = shape-based methods (new snakes for non-rigid, stochastic models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, sequential Bayesian algorithm multi-target)

Active Contours = Essentially, the active contour is a contour that seeks to optimize energy, where the energy quantifies the “goodness” of the 
		  contour. Essentially, the active contour is a contour that seeks to optimize energy, where the energy quantifies the “goodness”
		  of the contour—how smooth it is and how well localized it is with respect to the image edges. The movement of the active contour
		  is then motivated by minimizing this energy, making moves that improve the goodness of the contour in some manner.
Gradient Descent = energy minimization tool for active contours.
Dynamic programming = alternative to the gradient descent method.
Minimax method = for determining active contour parameter values.

Aproximar um contorno a uma coleção de pontos chamados snaxels.
