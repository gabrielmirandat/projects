WEB DESIGN = FRONT ends
WEB DEVELOPMENT = BACKEND

presentation layer (the 'front end') and a data access layer (the 'back end')
The front end is an interface between the user and the back end. The front and back ends may be distributed among one or more systems.

In software architecture, there may be many layers between the hardware and end user. Each can be spoken of as having a front end and 
a back end. The front is an abstraction, simplifying the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface.

In software design, for example, the model-view-controller architecture provides front and back ends for the database, the user and 
the data processing components.

'Front End'
part of the web that you can see and interact with.

2 parts: the web design and front end web development.

Everything that you see when using the web is a combination of 'HTML, CSS, and JavaScript' 
all being controlled by your computer’s browser.

to make all of this become a reality and to store the information that you put in the frontend elements,
we need technology to make it happen. Enter the backend…

'Backend'
3 parts: a server, an application, and a database.
You put data in a box in frontend. Once you’ve entered that information, the 
application stores it in a 
database that was created on a 
server. 
For sake of ease, just think about a database as a giant Excel spreadsheet on your computer, 
but your computer (server) is stored somewhere in Arizona.

All of that information stays on the server so when you log back into the application to 
print your tickets, all of the information is still there in your account.

backend developer: consist of languages like 'PHP, Ruby, Python', etc. To make them even easier to use they’re usually 
enhanced by frameworks like 'Ruby on Rails, Cake PHP, and Code Igniter' that all make development faster and easier to 
collaborate on.
