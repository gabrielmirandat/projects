Unsupervised learning=
+ Restricted Boltzmann Machine
+ Autoencoder

Supervised learning (you have labeled data and want to make a classifier)
-> Text Processing (like sentimental analysis, parsing, and named entity recognition)
  + Recurrent net
  + Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN)
-> Image Recognition (is there a cat?)
  + Deep Belief Network
  + Convolutional Net 
-> Object Recognition (Is there a pedestrian and a car?)
  + Concolutional Net
  + Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN)
-> Speech Recognition (reconhecer fala)
  + Recurrent Net
