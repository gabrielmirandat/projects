'IoT' (Internet of Things), which will be used to connect all
objects through the Internet for remote sensing and control.

'IoT' & 'M2M Ecosystem'.
Application Layer, 
Management Service Layer, 
Gateway & Network Layer, 
and Sensor Layer are explained.

IoT Technologies and 
'R&D' (Research & Development) 

IoT supportive wireless networking technologies.

Smartphones, OS, Cloud Computing, Big Data, CDN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile Communication, 
LTE, LTE-Advanced, IoT, AR, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and Internet operations.

'IoT' (including IoT wireless networks and services) and 
'AR' (including AR processes and feature extraction techniques) 
and how they can work together to provide services to our smartphones, laptops, PCs, and TVs.
